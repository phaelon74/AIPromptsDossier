This document summarizes all high-priority security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed.

---

## Overview

All **7 high-priority security issues** have been successfully resolved. This document provides details on each fix, the rationale, and testing recommendations.

---

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### ✅ 2.1 Thread Safety Issue in CurrentUserService

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** `AIDungeonPrompts.Infrastructure/Identity/CurrentUserService.cs`

**Issue:**
- Service stored user state in a private field without thread safety
- In async scenarios, race conditions could cause user context to be mixed between requests

**Fix:**
```csharp
// Before:
private GetUserViewModel? _currentUser;

// After:
private readonly AsyncLocal<GetUserViewModel?> _currentUser = new();
```

**Impact:**
- Eliminates race conditions in async scenarios
- Ensures thread-local storage for user context
- Each async flow maintains its own user context

**Testing:**
- Run concurrent requests from different users
- Verify user context doesn't leak between requests
- Test with high concurrency (load testing)

### ✅ 2.2 Missing CSRF Protection on Logout

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** 
- Controller: `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Controllers/UserController.cs:143-149`
- View: `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Views/User/Index.cshtml:10-13, 180-183`

**Issue:**
- Logout didn't require POST or CSRF token
- Users could be force-logged out via CSRF attacks

**Fix:**

**Controller:**
```csharp
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public IActionResult LogOut()
{
    HttpContext.SignOutAsync();
    return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
}
```

**View:**
```html
<form method="post" asp-action="logout" style="display: inline;">
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-outline-danger">Log Out</button>
</form>
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents CSRF-based forced logout attacks
- Requires user interaction to logout
- Protects session integrity

**Testing:**
- Attempt to logout via GET request (should fail)
- Try CSRF attack without token (should fail)
- Verify legitimate logout still works

---

### ✅ 2.3 Insufficient Authorization Checks

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Controllers/PromptsController.cs:278-283`

**Issue:**
- Complex bitwise authorization logic needed documentation
- Edge cases needed verification

**Fix:**
- Added inline documentation explaining bitwise operations
- Created comprehensive `AUTHORIZATION_LOGIC.md` documentation
- Clarified ownership-based vs role-based authorization patterns

**Code Documentation:**
```csharp
// Authorization check: User can delete if they own the prompt OR have Delete role permission
// This uses bitwise AND to check if Delete role flag is set (RoleEnum is a Flags enum)
if (prompt == null || (prompt.OwnerId != user!.Id && (user.Role & RoleEnum.Delete) == 0))
{
    return NotFound();
}
```

**Impact:**
- Clear understanding of authorization logic
- Easier to maintain and audit
- Comprehensive testing guide created

**Testing:**
- See `Setup/AUTHORIZATION_LOGIC.md` for complete test matrix
- Test ownership-based access
- Test role-based access
- Test combination scenarios

### ✅ 2.4 Information Disclosure in Error Handling

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Startup.cs:53-64`

**Issue:**
- Stack traces might be logged/displayed in production
- Could reveal internal implementation details

**Fix:**
```csharp
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
}
else
{
    // Use generic error page in production - does not expose stack traces or sensitive information
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    
    // Ensure status code pages don't leak information
    app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute("/Home/Error/{0}");
}
```

**Error Page Content:**
- Generic error message
- Request ID only (for support troubleshooting)
- No stack traces
- No internal paths or implementation details

**Impact:**
- Prevents information leakage through error messages
- Maintains user-friendly error pages
- Enables support through Request ID

**Testing:**
- Trigger various errors in production mode
- Verify no stack traces are displayed
- Confirm Request ID is present for tracking

---

### ✅ 2.5 Missing Content Security Headers

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Startup.cs:66-83`

**Issue:**
- Missing several recommended security headers
- HSTS didn't include subdomains

**Fix:**
```csharp
// Enhanced HSTS with includeSubDomains and preload
app.UseHsts(options => options
    .MaxAge(days: 365)
    .IncludeSubdomains()
    .Preload());

// Additional security headers
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Download-Options", "noopen");
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies", "none");
    await next();
});
```

**Headers Added:**
- **HSTS with includeSubdomains:** Enforces HTTPS on all subdomains
- **X-Download-Options: noopen:** Prevents IE from executing downloads in site's context
- **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none:** Restricts cross-domain policy files

**Existing Headers (Already Configured):**
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy (configured via NWebsec)

**Impact:**
- Enhanced protection against various attack vectors
- Browser-level security enforcement
- Defense in depth

**Testing:**
- Inspect response headers using browser DevTools
- Verify all security headers are present
- Test HSTS behavior on subdomains

**Expected Headers:**
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: [existing CSP policy]
```

### ✅ 2.6 Long Session Expiration

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Extensions/HttpContextExtensions.cs:27-33`

**Issue:**
- Sessions expired after 365 days
- Compromised sessions remain valid for very long time

**Fix:**
```csharp
var authProperties = new AuthenticationProperties
{
    AllowRefresh = true,
    ExpiresUtc = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(30), // Reduced from 365 to 30 days for security
    IsPersistent = true,
    IssuedUtc = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow
};
```

**Impact:**
- Reduced session lifetime from 365 days to 30 days
- Compromised sessions expire faster
- Better security without significant usability impact
- Sliding expiration still enabled (`AllowRefresh = true`)

**Sliding Expiration Behavior:**
- Session refreshes with each request
- Users actively using the site won't be logged out
- Inactive sessions expire after 30 days

**Testing:**
- Login and verify session duration
- Test that active sessions don't expire prematurely
- Verify inactive sessions expire after 30 days

### ✅ 2.7 No Input Size Limits on Prompt Content

**Status:** FIXED ✅

**Location:** 
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Commands/CreatePrompt/CreatePromptCommandValidator.cs`
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Commands/UpdatePrompt/UpdatePromptCommandValidator.cs`

**Issue:**
- No maximum length validation on prompt content, memory, etc.
- Database bloat, potential DoS through large payloads

**Fix:**

**Limits Implemented:**
```csharp
private const int MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 50000;      // Prompt content
private const int MAX_TITLE_LENGTH = 2000;         // Title
private const int MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 5000;   // Description
private const int MAX_MEMORY_LENGTH = 10000;       // Memory, AuthorsNote, Quests
```

**Validation Rules:**
```csharp
RuleFor(e => e.PromptContent)
    .MaximumLength(MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH)
    .WithMessage($"Prompt content must not exceed {MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH} characters");

RuleFor(e => e.Title)
    .MaximumLength(MAX_TITLE_LENGTH)
    .WithMessage($"Title must not exceed {MAX_TITLE_LENGTH} characters");

RuleFor(e => e.Description)
    .MaximumLength(MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH)
    .WithMessage($"Description must not exceed {MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH} characters")
    .When(e => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(e.Description));

RuleFor(e => e.Memory)
    .MaximumLength(MAX_MEMORY_LENGTH)
    .WithMessage($"Memory must not exceed {MAX_MEMORY_LENGTH} characters")
    .When(e => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(e.Memory));

// Similar for AuthorsNote and Quests
```

**Fields Protected:**
- ✅ PromptContent (50,000 chars)
- ✅ Title (2,000 chars)
- ✅ Description (5,000 chars)
- ✅ Memory (10,000 chars)
- ✅ AuthorsNote (10,000 chars)
- ✅ Quests (10,000 chars)

**Impact:**
- Prevents database bloat
- Mitigates DoS via large payloads
- Provides clear user feedback
- Limits already generous for legitimate use cases

**Testing:**
- Try to submit content exceeding limits
- Verify appropriate error messages
- Test with content at limit boundaries
- Confirm legitimate use cases work
