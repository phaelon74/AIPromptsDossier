# User Secrets vs Docker Secrets - Clarification Guide

**Version:** 2.1.0  
**Date:** October 2025

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document exists because there's often confusion between **User Secrets** and **Docker Secrets**. They sound similar but are completely different technologies for different scenarios.

---

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**Choose based on HOW you run the application:**

| How You Run It | What To Use | Setup Guide |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `docker-compose up` | **Docker Secrets** | `Setup/SetupDockerSecrets.md` |
| `dotnet run` | **User Secrets** | `Setup/UserSecretsSetup.md` |

**90% of users should use Docker Secrets** (production deployments).  
**User Secrets are only for developers doing local development**.

---

## Detailed Comparison

### Docker Secrets üê≥

**What It Is:**
- Docker's built-in secret management system
- Files mounted into containers at `/run/secrets/`
- Part of Docker Compose and Docker Swarm

**When To Use:**
- ‚úÖ Production deployments
- ‚úÖ Running with `docker-compose up`
- ‚úÖ Any Docker-based deployment
- ‚úÖ **This is the default for this project**

**Where Secrets Are Stored:**
```
/path/to/project/secrets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db_password.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ serilog_db_password.txt
```

**How They're Used:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./secrets/db_password.txt  # Read from file
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create secrets directory
mkdir -p secrets

# 2. Create password files
echo -n "YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD" > secrets/db_password.txt
echo -n "YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD" > secrets/serilog_db_password.txt

# 3. Secure them
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt

# 4. Add to .gitignore
echo "secrets/" >> .gitignore

# 5. Done! Docker Compose will mount them automatically
docker-compose up -d
```

**Documentation:** `Setup/SetupDockerSecrets.md`

### User Secrets üíª

**What It Is:**
- ASP.NET Core's development secrets system
- JSON file stored in your user profile
- **Only works in Development environment**

**When To Use:**
- ‚úÖ Local development with `dotnet run`
- ‚úÖ Debugging in Visual Studio/VS Code
- ‚úÖ Development WITHOUT Docker
- ‚ùå **NOT for production**
- ‚ùå **NOT used when running in Docker**

**Where Secrets Are Stored:**
```
# Linux/Mac
~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<user-secrets-id>/secrets.json

# Windows
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<user-secrets-id>\secrets.json
```

**How They're Used:**
```bash
# Command line
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AIDungeonPrompt" "Host=localhost;...;Password=DEV_PASSWORD;"

# Or in Visual Studio: Right-click project ‚Üí Manage User Secrets
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd AIDungeonPromptsWeb

# 2. Initialize (creates UserSecretsId in .csproj)
dotnet user-secrets init

# 3. Set your connection string with password
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AIDungeonPrompt" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=aidungeonprompts;Username=aidungeonprompts_user;Password=YOUR_DEV_PASSWORD;"

# 4. Run application
dotnet run

# User Secrets automatically loaded in Development environment
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Production Deployment (Most Common)

**What you're doing:**
- Deploying to a server
- Running with Docker Compose
- Production environment

**What to use:**
```bash
# Docker Secrets
mkdir -p secrets
echo -n "PROD_PASSWORD" > secrets/db_password.txt
echo -n "PROD_PASSWORD" > secrets/serilog_db_password.txt
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Don't use:** User Secrets (they won't work in Docker)

---

### Scenario 2: Local Development Without Docker

**What you're doing:**
- Developing on your laptop
- Running `dotnet run` or debugging in IDE
- Testing code changes quickly

**What to use:**
```bash
# User Secrets
cd AIDungeonPromptsWeb
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AIDungeonPrompt" "Host=localhost;...;Password=DEV_PASSWORD;"
dotnet run
```

**Don't use:** Docker Secrets (you're not running Docker)

---

### Scenario 3: Developer Using Docker Locally

**What you're doing:**
- Developing on your laptop
- Running with Docker to match production
- Testing containerized deployment

**What to use:**
```bash
# Docker Secrets
mkdir -p secrets
echo -n "DEV_PASSWORD" > secrets/db_password.txt
echo -n "DEV_PASSWORD" > secrets/serilog_db_password.txt
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Don't use:** User Secrets (Docker ignores them)

---

### Scenario 4: Team with Mixed Workflows

**What you're doing:**
- Some developers use `dotnet run`
- Others use Docker
- Everyone needs to work

**What to use:**
```bash
# Setup BOTH (they don't conflict)

# For dotnet run developers:
cd AIDungeonPromptsWeb
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AIDungeonPrompt" "..."

# For Docker developers:
mkdir -p secrets
echo -n "PASSWORD" > secrets/db_password.txt
```

**Result:** Everyone can work in their preferred way

---

## How The Application Chooses

The application automatically uses the right secret based on how it's running:

### When Running with `dotnet run`:
1. Loads `appsettings.json` ‚Üí Gets connection string WITHOUT password
2. Loads `appsettings.Development.json` ‚Üí Still no password
3. Loads **User Secrets** ‚Üí Gets password from User Secrets
4. Final connection string: From appsettings + password from User Secrets ‚úÖ

### When Running with Docker:
1. Loads `appsettings.json` ‚Üí Gets connection string WITHOUT password
2. Environment variable from docker-compose.yml overrides it
3. Reads `/run/secrets/db_password` ‚Üí Gets password from Docker Secret
4. Appends password to connection string
5. Final connection string: From environment + password from Docker Secret ‚úÖ

**The code in `Startup.cs` handles this automatically.**

---

## Code Reference

**In `Startup.cs`:**

```csharp
private string GetDatabaseConnectionString()
{
    // Get base connection string (from appsettings or environment)
    var connectionString = Configuration.GetConnectionString(DatabaseConnectionName);
    
    // Validate it exists
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(connectionString))
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Database connection string not configured");
    }
    
    // If running in Docker, read password from Docker Secret
    if (File.Exists(ConfigurationConstants.DatabasePasswordSecretPath))  // /run/secrets/db_password
    {
        var password = File.ReadAllText(ConfigurationConstants.DatabasePasswordSecretPath).Trim();
        connectionString += $"Password={password};";
    }
    // If running locally with dotnet run, User Secrets already loaded by ASP.NET Core
    
    return connectionString;
}
```

**Key Point:** User Secrets are loaded automatically by ASP.NET Core's configuration system in Development. Docker Secrets are manually read from `/run/secrets/` when present.

## Troubleshooting

### "My User Secrets aren't working in Docker"

**Problem:** User Secrets only work with `dotnet run`, not Docker.

**Solution:** Use Docker Secrets instead:
```bash
mkdir -p secrets
echo -n "YOUR_PASSWORD" > secrets/db_password.txt
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
```

---

### "My Docker Secrets aren't working locally"

**Problem:** Docker Secrets only work when running with Docker.

**Solution:** Use User Secrets instead:
```bash
cd AIDungeonPromptsWeb
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AIDungeonPrompt" "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=aidungeonprompts;Username=aidungeonprompts_user;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
dotnet run
```

---

### "I setup User Secrets but still getting connection errors in Docker"

**Problem:** Docker doesn't use User Secrets, it needs Docker Secrets.

**Solution:** 
```bash
# Check if Docker Secrets are configured
ls -la secrets/

# If not, create them
mkdir -p secrets
echo -n "YOUR_PASSWORD" > secrets/db_password.txt
echo -n "YOUR_PASSWORD" > secrets/serilog_db_password.txt
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt

# Restart containers
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

---

### "Which one should I use?"

**Answer:** 
- Running `docker-compose up`? ‚Üí **Docker Secrets**
- Running `dotnet run`? ‚Üí **User Secrets**
- When in doubt, use **Docker Secrets** (works for production)

---

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use Docker Secrets for all Docker deployments
- Use User Secrets for local development (optional)
- Keep both types of secrets OUT of git
- Use different passwords for dev vs production
- Document which secrets your team uses

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Don't commit User Secrets to git (they're in your user profile anyway)
- Don't commit Docker Secrets to git (add `secrets/` to .gitignore)
- Don't use User Secrets in production
- Don't expect User Secrets to work in Docker
- Don't mix them up in documentation
