# Critical Security Fixes - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the critical security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in this update.

## Overview

All 7 critical security vulnerabilities identified in the initial security audit have been successfully addressed. This includes database security, password policies, rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms, and path traversal protection.

---

## ✅ Fix 1.1: Database Backup Location Security

### Problem
Database backup was stored in `wwwroot/backup.db`, making it publicly accessible via HTTP.

### Solution
- Moved backup location to `/AIPromptDossier/backups/` (outside web root)
- Configured Docker volume mount: `/media/main/AIPromptDossier/backups:/AIPromptDossier/backups`
- Updated `Startup.cs` to use new backup path

### Files Changed
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Startup.cs`
- `docker-compose.yml`

---

## ✅ Fix 1.2: Docker and Database Security

### Problem
- PostgreSQL running in Docker with hardcoded password "example"
- No secrets management
- Insecure configuration

### Solution
- Removed PostgreSQL from docker-compose (now runs on host system)
- Implemented Docker Secrets for database credentials
- Created comprehensive database setup SQL script
- Created detailed Docker Secrets setup documentation

### Files Changed
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed PostgreSQL service, added Docker Secrets configuration
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Startup.cs` - Added Docker Secrets reading logic
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/appsettings.json` - Updated connection string
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/appsettings.Development.json` - Updated for dev environment

### Files Created
- `Setup/CreateDatabase.sql` - Complete database schema with all tables
- `Setup/SetupDockerSecrets.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

### Security Improvements
- Passwords never stored in code or configuration
- Database runs on host with proper isolation
- Secrets stored in encrypted Docker secrets
- Comprehensive documentation for secure setup

## ✅ Fix 1.3: Strong Password Policy

### Problem
No password complexity requirements - users could set passwords like "a" or "password"

### Solution
Implemented comprehensive password validation requiring:
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?\":{}|<>)

### Files Changed
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Commands/CreateUser/CreateUserCommandValidator.cs`
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Commands/UpdateUser/UpdateUserCommandValidator.cs`

### Implementation Details
- Uses FluentValidation with regex-based validation
- Clear error messages for each requirement
- Applies to both user registration and password updates

## ✅ Fix 1.4: Rate Limiting and Account Lockout

### Problem
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- No account lockout mechanism
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks

### Solution
Implemented comprehensive account lockout system:
- Tracks all login attempts with timestamps and IP addresses
- Allows 5 failed attempts without delay
- Implements 1-minute backoff for attempts 6-10
- Permanently locks account after 10 failed attempts (requires admin unlock)
- Tracks lockout periods and reasons
- Admin interface for account management

### Files Created

#### Domain Entities
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Domain/Entities/LoginAttempt.cs`
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Domain/Entities/AccountLockout.cs`

#### Database Configurations
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Persistence/Configurations/LoginAttemptConfiguration.cs`
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Persistence/Configurations/AccountLockoutConfiguration.cs`

#### Services
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Abstractions/Identity/IAccountLockoutService.cs`
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Infrastructure/Identity/AccountLockoutService.cs`

#### Exceptions
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Queries/LogIn/AccountLockedException.cs`
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Queries/LogIn/LoginBackoffException.cs`

### Files Updated
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Domain/Entities/User.cs` - Added relationships
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Persistence/DbContexts/AIDungeonPromptsDbContext.cs` - Added DbSets
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Queries/LogIn/LogInQuery.cs` - Integrated lockout logic
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Controllers/UserController.cs` - Added exception handling
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Infrastructure/InfrastructureInjectionExtensions.cs` - Registered service
- `Setup/CreateDatabase.sql` - Added new tables

### Lockout Behavior
1. **Attempts 1-5**: No delay, immediate feedback
2. **Attempts 6-10**: 60-second backoff period between attempts
3. **After 10 attempts**: Permanent lockout requiring admin intervention
4. **Successful login**: Resets failed attempt counter

## ✅ Fix 1.4a: Admin Section for Account Management

### Problem
No administrative interface to manage user accounts, unlock locked accounts, or reset passwords.

### Solution
Created comprehensive admin section with:
- User management dashboard
- Account unlock functionality
- Role assignment capability
- Password reset functionality
- Admin-only access control

### Files Created
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Controllers/AdminController.cs`
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Constants/PolicyValueConstants.cs`
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Constants/ClaimValueConstants.cs`

### Files Updated
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Domain/Enums/RoleEnum.cs` - Added Admin role (value: 8)
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Helpers/RoleHelper.cs` - Added IsAdmin() method
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Startup.cs` - Added AdminsOnly policy
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Extensions/HttpContextExtensions.cs` - Added IsAdmin claim

### Admin Features
- **View Users**: List all users with their roles and lockout status
- **Unlock Accounts**: Remove lockouts and reset failed attempt counters
- **Update Roles**: Assign/modify user roles (Admin, Editor, Delete, etc.)
- **Reset Passwords**: Admin can reset user passwords (must meet complexity requirements)

### Access Control
- Admin role is a flag enum value (8)
- Requires `[Authorize(Policy = PolicyValueConstants.AdminsOnly)]`
- Claims-based authorization with `IsAdmin` claim

## ✅ Fix 1.5: User Enumeration Prevention

### Problem
Different error messages revealed whether a username existed in the system.

### Solution
- Implemented generic error messages that don't reveal username existence
- Registration errors: "Registration failed. Please try again with a different username or password."
- Update errors: "Update failed. The username or password cannot be used. Please try different values."
- Login errors: Generic "Username or Password was incorrect" (unchanged)

### Files Changed
- `AIDungeonPromptsWeb/Controllers/UserController.cs`
  - Register action: Generic error for UsernameNotUniqueException
  - Edit action: Generic error for UsernameNotUniqueException

### Security Benefit
Attackers cannot enumerate valid usernames by testing registrations or observing error messages.

---

## ✅ Fix 1.7: ZIP Path Traversal Protection

### Problem
No validation of zip file entry names, allowing potential path traversal attacks via malicious zip files (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`).

### Solution
Implemented comprehensive ZIP entry validation:
- Checks for null or empty entry names
- Detects and blocks null bytes (`\0`)
- Prevents absolute paths
- Blocks parent directory references (`../`)
- Validates path components
- Limits directory depth (max 2 levels)
- Validates before extracting any files

### Files Changed
- `AIDungeonPrompts.Application/Helpers/ZipHelper.cs`

### Protection Against
- Path traversal (`../../../sensitive_file`)
- Absolute paths (`/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32\`)
- Null byte injection
- Deeply nested directory structures
- Hidden parent directory references in path components

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

#### LoginAttempts
```sql
- Id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- UserId (INTEGER, FK to Users)
- Success (BOOLEAN)
- IpAddress (VARCHAR(45))
- AttemptDate (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- DateCreated (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- DateEdited (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
```

#### AccountLockouts
```sql
- Id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- UserId (INTEGER, FK to Users)
- LockoutStart (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- LockoutEnd (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, NULL = permanent)
- FailedAttempts (INTEGER)
- IsActive (BOOLEAN)
- LockedByAdmin (TEXT)
- DateCreated (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- DateEdited (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
```

### Indexes Added
- `IX_LoginAttempts_UserId`
- `IX_LoginAttempts_AttemptDate`
- `IX_AccountLockouts_UserId`
- `IX_AccountLockouts_UserId_IsActive` (composite)

## Migration Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the database creation script
psql -U postgres -f Setup/CreateDatabase.sql
```

### 2. Docker Secrets Setup
```bash
# Follow the guide in Setup/SetupDockerSecrets.md
mkdir -p secrets
echo -n "your_secure_password" > secrets/db_password.txt
echo -n "your_secure_password" > secrets/serilog_db_password.txt
chmod 600 secrets/*.txt
```

### 3. Create Backup Directory
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/main/AIPromptDossier/backups
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/main/AIPromptDossier/backups
chmod 755 /media/main/AIPromptDossier/backups
```

### 4. Update .gitignore
```bash
echo "secrets/" >> .gitignore
```

### 5. Deploy Application
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Password Policy Testing
1. Try creating users with weak passwords (should fail)
2. Test each password requirement individually
3. Verify error messages are clear and helpful

### Account Lockout Testing
1. Attempt 5 failed logins (should work with no delay)
2. Attempt 6th login (should see 60-second backoff message)
3. Continue to 10 failed attempts (should see account locked message)
4. Verify admin can unlock the account
5. Test successful login resets failed attempts

### Path Traversal Testing
1. Create zip file with `../` in entry names
2. Attempt to upload - should be rejected
3. Test various path traversal techniques
4. Verify only valid files are accepted

### User Enumeration Testing
1. Register with existing username
2. Verify error doesn't confirm username exists
3. Test update with conflicting username
4. Verify consistent error messages

### Docker Secrets Testing
1. Verify application starts without errors
2. Check database connection works
3. Verify secrets are not visible in `docker inspect`
4. Test backup functionality with new paths
